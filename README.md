# Hello ACM Dev Team!

This is my submission for the Challenge A of the ACM Dev challenges.

### A little bit about this project:

The theme of this news website is wacky. Its just a site that does the opposite of taking itself seriously. I tried to have the color scheme be something like you would find in a bowling alley carpet from the 2000s. The content of the articles is nonsensical.

The layout is just a flexbox layout that wraps around the article sections on resize, nothing too fancy. I wanted to make a css grid layout but couldnt find the right vision for it, so I opted for the quicker solution.

I had 3 days to make this website internixed with a busy school week, so I definitely was rushed for time. I had an idea for what I wanted to do that involved draggable section headers with react-use-gesture, but I quickly realized that I needed more time for that just to figure it out, so I ended up scaling down my prospects for the site.

If I was given more time, here are the immediate steps I would have taken to improve this submission:

> -> Finished the requirements of adding individually templated articles for each type of article, for example an image on the cooking section, a weather display on the weather section
>
> -> Spent more time finding a good theme to match the wacky aesthetic of what I was going for with the website
>
> -> Used react-router and @react-spring to transition to the individual article pages when clicking into an article preview
> 
> -> made a better mobile layout and improved the CSS
>
> -> Randomized fact of the day
>
> -> experimented with Tailwind or other component UI frameworks

### Nevertheless, I am satisfied with what I was able to make in 3 days in between my busy schedule. Thank you for considering me to a spot on the ACM Dev team!
