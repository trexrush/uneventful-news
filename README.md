# Hello ACM Dev Team!

This is my submission for the Challenge A of the ACM Dev challenges.

### A little bit about this project:

The theme of this news website is wacky. Its just a site that does the opposite of taking itself seriously. I tried to have the color scheme be something like you would find in a bowling alley carpet from the 2000s. The content of the articles is nonsensical.

The layout is just a flexbox layout that wraps around the article sections on resize, nothing too fancy. I wanted to make a css grid layout but couldnt find the right vision for it, so I opted for the quicker solution.

I had 3 days to make this website internixed with a busy school week, so I definitely was rushed for time. I had an idea for what I wanted to do that involved draggable section headers with react-use-gesture, but I quickly realized that I needed more time for that just to figure it out, so I ended up scaling down my prospects for the site.

If I was given more time, here are the immediate steps I would have taken to improve this submission:

> -> Finished the requirements of adding individually templated articles for each type of article, for example an image on the cooking section, a weather display on the weather section
>
> -> Spent more time finding a good theme to match the wacky aesthetic of what I was going for with the website
>
> -> Used react-router and @react-spring to transition to the individual article pages when clicking into an article preview
> 
> -> made a better mobile layout and improved the CSS
>
> -> Randomized fact of the day
>
> -> experimented with Tailwind or other component UI frameworks

### Nevertheless, I am satisfied with what I was able to make in 3 days in between my busy schedule. Thank you for considering me to a spot on the ACM Dev team!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
